# Abstract Account Project

This project demonstrates a very basic Abstract account, meaning a wallet that is a smart contract instead of a traditional wallet. This example has a smart contract wallet that is capable of storing and sending Eth and ERC20 tokens. This wallet can be used by anyone who knows the wallet password, instead of a seedphrase, this allows easy wallet sharing between users, or password recovery by storing your password with a friend or an institution.

# How to run


After cloning the repo, you will want to do the following to get the code running on your computer.

- Inside the project directory, in the terminal type: `npm i`
- Run `npx hardhat compile` and `npx hardhat test` to compile solidity code and verify it works
- Open two additional terminals in your VS code
- In the second terminal type: `npx hardhat node`
- In the third terminal, type: `npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.ts` to deploy Degen token
- Create a `.env.local` file in the root folder and put `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEGEN_TOKEN_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=%{Deployed contract adress}%`, filling in the address deploy script printed
- Back in the first terminal, type `npm run dev` to launch the front-end.

After this, the project will be running on your localhost. 
Typically at http://localhost:3000/

In your browser, pull up your Metamask (or similar) wallet, and import some accounts using private keys generated by hardhat, printed in the terminal where you ran `npx hardhat node`.
Then add hardhat local network to Metamask:
- Network Name `HardhatNetwork` (can be anything really)
- RPC url `http://127.0.0.1:8545` (check the node terminal, this might be different)
- Chain ID `31337`

Now you should be able to to connect to the web UI and interact with the dApp via your web3 wallet.
